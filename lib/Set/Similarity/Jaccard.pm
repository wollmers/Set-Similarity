=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Jaccard Index

The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets, and is defined as the 
size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets

( A intersect B ) / (A union B)

The Tanimoto coefficient is the ratio of the number of elements common to both sets to 
the total number of elements, i.e.

( A intersect B ) / ( A + B - ( A intersect B ) ) # the same as Jaccard 

The range is 0 to 1 inclusive.

=head1 METHODS

L<Set::Similarity::Jaccard> inherits all methods from L<Set::Similarity> and implements the
following new ones.

=head2 from_sets

  my $similarity = $object->from_sets({'a' => undef},{'b' => undef});
