=head1 NAME

Set::Similarity - similarity measures for sets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Set::Similarity::Dice;
 my $dice = Set::Similarity::Dice->new;
 my $similarity = $dice->from_string('Photographer','Fotograf');

=head1 DESCRIPTION


Overlap coefficient

( A intersect B ) / min(A,B)

Jaccard Index

The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets

( A intersect B ) / (A union B)

The Tanimoto coefficient is the ratio of the number of features common to both molecules to the total number of features, i.e.

( A intersect B ) / ( A + B - ( A intersect B ) ) # the same as Jaccard 

The range is 0 to 1 inclusive. 

The Dice coefficient is the number of features in common to both molecules relative to the average size of the total number of features present, i.e.

( A intersect B ) / 0.5 ( A + B ) # the same as sorensen

The weighting factor comes from the 0.5 in the denominator. The range is 0 to 1.
